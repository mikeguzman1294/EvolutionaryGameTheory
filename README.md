# Evolutionary Game Theory
## Evolutionary Game Theory and Agent-Based Modelling

***
This repository contains the NetLogo implementation of several Evolutionary Game Theory simulations based on the classic Hawk-Dove games.

It also contains a Jupyter notebook which serves as a parser script for processing Netlogo's simulation data into a suitable format for data analysis.

Furthermore, a report document describing with detail the nature of the particular game variants and explaining the rationales of all implementations can be found in the Documentation folder as a PDF file.
